# **UNRAVEL MOBILE®**

# **Description**

Unravel Mobile® is a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Tool for Patients and Therapists.

•  Traditional Method: Based on the Automatic Thought Record: A pen & paper therapeutic tool (weekly    homework).

•  Challenge: Therapists have challenges with patients completing the ATR. 

•  Approach: Leverage mobile to engage patients to completing the ATR

Unravel Mobile® offers an alternative to the traditional method of recording destressing events, which a lot of times by the time the oportunity of putting pen to paper finally arrives the emotions are not the same; Unravel Mobile® offers the user the opportunity to log how they are feeling at the touch of a couple of buttons.
